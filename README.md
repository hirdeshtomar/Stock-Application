# Stock-Application

This repository contains the Spring Boot Maven Project for the Payconiq Stock Application assignment.


## Assignment Details:

Assignment - Backend Developer Application. To create a java based backend application using REST. It should contain the following endpoints;  

GET /api/stocks (get a list of stocks)
GET /api/stocks/1 (get one stock from the list)
PUT /api/stocks/1 (update the price of a single stock)
POST /api/stocks (create a stock)  

The list of stocks should be created in memory on application startup.
The stock object contains at least the fields; id (Number), name (String), currentPrice (Amount) and lastUpdate (Timestamp).
Use the frameworks as you see fit to build and test this.  

Nice to have - a front-end which shows the stock list.  

NOTE: Please do not use a generator (like yeoman)
